function [fLarmorOut, tEcho, df] = get_fLarmorFitTotEcho(HW, fLarmorIn, tEcho)
%% Calculate a Larmor frequency whose period has an integer multiple to tEcho
%
%     [fLarmorOut, tEcho, df] = get_fLarmorFitTotEcho(HW, fLarmorIn, tEcho)
%
% INPUT:
%   HW          HW structure or object
%   fLarmorIn   Larmor frequency in Hz. This frequency is changed to the closest
%               that has an integer multiple to the (fixed) Echo time (see
%               below).
%   tEcho       Echo time in seconds. This time is rounded to the closest grid
%               defined by the system frequency of the controller.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   fLarmorOut  Larmor frequency in Hz that fulfills the requirement.
%   tEcho       Echo time in seconds rounded to the system frequency grid.
%   df          Difference in Hz of the returned Larmor frequency to the input
%               Larmor frequency.
