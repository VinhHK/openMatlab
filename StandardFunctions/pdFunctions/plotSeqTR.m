function plotSeqTR(HW, Seq, AQ, TX, Grad)
%% Plot sequence with stacked "tRep"s
%
%   plotSeqTR(HW, Seq, AQ, TX, Grad)
%
% This function opens a figure showing the pulse program (rf pulses, acquisition
% windows, gradient pulses and digital IO signals) of the sequence. The "tRep"s
% starting at Seq.plotSeqStart and ending with Seq.plotSeqEnd are stacked upon
% each other such that each tRep begins at t=0s.
%
% INPUT:
%   See help for "plotSeq" with the following deviations:
%     Seq.plotSequence.wraps is always set to Inf
%     The default value for Seq.plotSequence.figureName is 'Pulse Program
%     (wrapped at each tRep)'.
%     The default value for Seq.plotSequence.Gradients is Seq.plotSeqTR (which
%     defaults to 1:3).
%
% OUTPUT:
%   none
