function [fLarmorOut, tEcho, df] = get_tEchoFitTofLarmor(HW, fLarmorIn, tEcho)
%% Calculate an Echo time that is an integer multiple of the Larmor period
%
%      [fLarmorOut, tEcho, df] = get_tEchoFitTofLarmor(HW, fLarmorIn, tEcho)
%
% INPUT:
%   HW          HW structure or object
%   fLarmorIn   Larmor frequency in Hz. This frequency is slightly changed to
%               find a tEcho that is an integer multiple of the (adapted) Larmor
%               period.
%   tEcho       Echo time in seconds. This time is an integer multiple of the
%               adapted Larmor frequency and lies on the grid defined by the
%               system frequency of the controller.
%               If tEcho is a scalar, it can be varied by +/- 1000/HW.TX.fSample
%               or 5% of its value (whichever is smaller).
%               Otherwise, the minimum and maximum value in tEcho are used to
%               define the span in which the Echo time might vary.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   fLarmorOut  Larmor frequency in Hz that fulfills the requirements.
%   tEcho       Echo time in seconds that fulfills the requirements.
%   df          Difference in Hz of the returned Larmor frequency to the input
%               Larmor frequency.
